                Hi, my name is Airell Mantilla and I am a first generation
                Filipino-Canadian.
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently studying Computer Science at Seneca College, which
                is something I've been passionate about for a while now. Before
                coming to Seneca, I attended Georgian College for Graphic
                Design, but unfortunately, I ended up dropping out after a year.
                After that, I decided to pursue a different path and enrolled in
                Police Foundations at Humber College, which I successfully
                graduated from with honours.
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Although my journey to finding my passion has had its ups and
                downs, I'm grateful for the experiences that have led me to
                where I am today.
              </p>

          <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
          <div class="row">
            <p>
              In the past few years, I've achieved a lot that I'm truly proud
              of. I'm particularly proud of graduating with honors in police
              foundations, a rigorous program that demanded a lot of hard work
              and discipline. Through this program, I gained a deep
              understanding of law enforcement practices and procedures, as well
              as valuable leadership and problem-solving skills that will
              benefit me in my future career.
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Another accomplishment I'm proud of is attaining the Masters rank
              in Teamfight Tactics, a game that required dedication, strategic
              thinking, and skill. I climbed to rank #1,603 in the North
              American ladder, putting me in the top 0.2% of players. While the
              journey was challenging, it taught me self-discipline and
              adaptability, providing invaluable lessons.

            <p class="italic-p">My peak rank!</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Ultimately, my achievements would not have been possible without
              the support of my friends and family, as well as my own
              determination and focus on my goals. I believe that anything is
              possible with effort, and I look forward to continuing to push
              myself to new heights.

          <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
          <p>
            I absolutely love going to the gym and pushing myself to the limit.
            Powerlifting has become a passion of mine and I strive to
            continually improve and become stronger. When I'm not lifting
            weights at the gym, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music,
            and spending time with my friends and family. I also love exploring
            new places and trying new foods, and I hope to one day travel the
            world and experience different cultures.
