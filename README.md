# Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

The website includes the following sections:

- Home: This section includes a brief introduction and has links to my Linkedin, Github, and Instagram profiles.

- About Me: This section includes a more detailed bio, my accomplishments, and my hobbies & interests.

Clicking on the "Resume" button in the header section will open a downloadable PDF version of my resume in a new tab.
